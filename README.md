# Colour-image-compression-using-Chroma-subsampled-luma-modification

Reducing the transmission rate of an RGB image by apply bilinear interpolation in a chroma accordinng to modified luma.

By my new algorthem for luma modification:
  overall 25% of luma components were saved from transmission of single frame - 
  transmission rate will be increase - 
  due to less transmission ,data usage also reduced - 
need to improve:
  to optimize my code to faster execution - 
  to optimize my algorthem to get more Peek signal to noice ratio.
